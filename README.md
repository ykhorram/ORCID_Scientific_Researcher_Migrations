Chord plots: a picture worth a thousand word

Chord plots are one of most informative visualization tools fitted to show the number or fraction of interactions between different enteties. As such, it is a great fit to display the migration patterns of scientists. In this kernel, I use plotly to display the graph of scientific migrations.

Data came from [Kaggle Scientific Researcher Migrations competetion](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/scientist-migrations),
which introduces ORCID as a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes researchers from one another. Integrating the ORCID in key research workflows such as manuscript and grant submission, automates the linkages between scientist's professional activities and ensurs that they each would recieve recognition for their work.

Since the output is interactive, it won't display on github to see the final product go to the following link:
