# ORCID_Scientific_Researcher_Migrations

Chord plots when a picture worth a thousand word:

Chord plots are one of most informative visualization tools fitted to show the number and fraction of interactions between different enteties.
As such, they are a great fit to display the migration patterns of scientists. 
In this kernel, I use plotly to display the graph of scientific migrations.

Data came from [Kaggle Scientific Researcher Migrations competetion](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/scientist-migrations),
which introduces ORCID as a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes researchers from one another and, through integration in key research workflows such as manuscript and grant submission, supports automated linkages between scientist's professional activities ensuring that they recieve recognition for their work.
